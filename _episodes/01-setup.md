When we use Git on a new computer for the first time,
we need to configure a few things. Below are a few examples
of configurations we will set as we get started with Git:

*   our name and email address,
*   what our preferred text editor is,
*   and that we want to use these settings globally (i.e. for every project).

On a command line, Git commands are written as `git verb options`,
where `verb` is what we actually want to do and `options` is additional optional information which may be needed for the `verb`. So here is how
Dracula sets up his new laptop:

~~~
$ git config --global user.name "Vlad Dracula"
$ git config --global user.email "vlad@tran.sylvan.ia"
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Please use your own name and email address instead of Dracula's. This user name and email will be associated with your subsequent Git activity,
which means that any changes pushed to
[GitHub](https://github.com/),
[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/),
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) or
another Git host server
in a later lesson will include this information.

> ## Line Endings
>
> As with other keys, when you hit <kbd>Return</kbd> on your keyboard,
> your computer encodes this input as a character.
> Different operating systems use different character(s) to represent the end of a line.
> (You may also hear these referred to as newlines or line breaks.)
> Because Git uses these characters to compare files,
> it may cause unexpected issues when editing a file on different machines. 
> Though it is beyond the scope of this lesson, you can read more about this issue 
> [on this GitHub page](https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings/).
{: .callout}
>
> You can change the way Git recognizes and encodes line endings
> using the `core.autocrlf` command to `git config`.
> The following settings are recommended:
>
> On macOS and Linux:
>
> ~~~
> $ git config --global core.autocrlf input
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> And on Windows:
>
> ~~~
> $ git config --global core.autocrlf true
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
> 

For these lessons, we will be interacting with [GitHub](https://github.com/) and so the email address used should be the same as the one used when setting up your GitHub account. If you are concerned about privacy, please review [GitHub's instructions for keeping your email address private][git-privacy]. 
If you elect to use a private email address with GitHub, then use that same email address for the `user.email` value, e.g. `username@users.noreply.github.com` replacing `username` with your GitHub one. You can change the email address later on by using the `git config` command again.

Dracula also has to set his favorite text editor, following this table:

| Editor             | Configuration command                            |
|:-------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| Atom | `$ git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"`|
| nano               | `$ git config --global core.editor "nano -w"`    |
| BBEdit (Mac, with command line tools) | `$ git config --global core.editor "bbedit -w"`    |
| Sublime Text (Mac) | `$ git config --global core.editor "/Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl -n -w"` |
| Sublime Text (Win, 32-bit install) | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files (x86)/sublime text 3/sublime_text.exe' -w"` |
| Sublime Text (Win, 64-bit install) | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files/sublime text 3/sublime_text.exe' -w"` |
| Notepad++ (Win, 32-bit install)    | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files (x86)/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"`|
| Notepad++ (Win, 64-bit install)    | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"`|
| Kate (Linux)       | `$ git config --global core.editor "kate"`       |
| Gedit (Linux)      | `$ git config --global core.editor "gedit --wait --new-window"`   |
| Scratch (Linux)       | `$ git config --global core.editor "scratch-text-editor"`  |
| Emacs              | `$ git config --global core.editor "emacs"`   |
| Vim                | `$ git config --global core.editor "vim"`   |

It is possible to reconfigure the text editor for Git whenever you want to change it.

> ## Exiting Vim
>
> Note that Vim is the default editor for many programs. If you haven't used Vim before and wish to exit a session without saving
your changes, press <kbd>Esc</kbd> then type `:q!` and hit <kbd>Return</kbd>.
> If you want to save your changes and quit, press <kbd>Esc</kbd> then type `:wq` and hit <kbd>Return</kbd>.
{: .callout}

The four commands we just ran above only need to be run once: the flag `--global` tells Git
to use the settings for every project, in your user account, on this computer.

You can check your settings at any time:

~~~
$ git config --list
~~~
{: .language-bash}

You can change your configuration as many times as you want: use the
same commands to choose another editor or update your email address.

> ## Proxy
>
> In some networks you need to use a
> [proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server). If this is the case, you
> may also need to tell Git about the proxy:
>
> ~~~
> $ git config --global http.proxy proxy-url
> $ git config --global https.proxy proxy-url
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> To disable the proxy, use
>
> ~~~
> $ git config --global --unset http.proxy
> $ git config --global --unset https.proxy
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
{: .callout}

> ## Git Help and Manual
>
> Always remember that if you forget a `git` command, you can access the list of commands by using `-h` and access the Git manual by using `--help` :
>
> ~~~
> $ git config -h
> $ git config --help
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
{: .callout}

# Setting up SSH keys
In the lesson today we will use SSH keys for fast easy access to github.com. First we need to generate an SSH key for the machine we're using, with
~~~
ssh-keygen
~~~
We can press enter to accept the default location. You may choose a passphrase to protect your keys, or you can leave this empty.

>## Warning: overwritting keys
>If you already have a key, ssh-keygen will warn you that it is about to overwrite a file. If this happens, press n and then ENTER to confirm that you *don't* want to overwrite the file. You may skip this step.
{: .keypoints}

Next we want to add this key on github.com. To do this, visit the
<a href='https://github.com/settings/keys'>
https://github.com/settings/keys
</a>
page, and hit the "New Key" button. You should see the following menu box:

Enter a meaningful description of the machine your using that will make sense to future you, such as "Work Laptop". In the *Key* field, we should enter the public RSA key. We can get this key by typing at the command line
~~~
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
~~~
Copy the output of this command into the *Key* field and hit the "Add SSH Key" button to submit.

![ssh-keys-github-form.png](../fig/ssh-keys-github-form.png)

You should be able to connect to github.com now. We can verify this with
~~~
ssh -T git@github.com
~~~
You may see one of the following warnings:
~~~
> The authenticity of host 'github.com (IP ADDRESS)' can't be established.
  > RSA key fingerprint is 16:27:ac:a5:76:28:2d:36:63:1b:56:4d:eb:df:a6:48.
  > Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
~~~
or
~~~
> The authenticity of host 'github.com (IP ADDRESS)' can't be established.
  > RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:nThbg6kXUpJWGl7E1IGOCspRomTxdCARLviKw6E5SY8.
  > Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
~~~
Verify that the message you see matches one of the ones above. If it does, continue by typing
~~~
yes
~~~
and hitting enter. You should then see a message which says
~~~
> Hi <username>! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not
> provide shell access.
~~~
The placeholder \<username\> in this text should contain your github username. If it does, then the setup is correct and we're good to go! If you get anything else, check your setup or ask a helper to look over your setup with you before proceeding.
